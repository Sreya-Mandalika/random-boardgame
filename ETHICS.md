# Ethics of the Random Boardgame Generator
## Purpose of data collection
I am collecting this data for two main reasons:
1. For educational purposes - I need to do web-scraping for a class project
2. I am interested in boardgames, so I wanted to create a tool that would generate a random boardgame for
   me so that I can explore new ones. I wanted to focus on more popular games, aka the 'top 100 games'.

## Data sources and robots.txt
This site does not have much API access or documentation, which makes it interesting to scrape. General access for 
most of the pages, including the browse boardgame page, is allowed according to the robots.txt file.

## Collection practices
I have only done scraping on one main section of the website (browse boardgames) to avoid major disruption to the wesite. 
There are no password protections I have bypassed.

## Data handling and privacy
There is no confidential data within the file; it is only data publicly accessible to everyone looking at the website.

## Data usage
This data will only be used for educational purposes (for a class project), and not for any other reason, monetary or otherwise.
